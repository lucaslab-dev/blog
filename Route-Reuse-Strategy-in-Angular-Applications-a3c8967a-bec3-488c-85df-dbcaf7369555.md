
Let's create a custom `RouteReuseStrategy` for your Angular application that handles route transitions between different blog posts. This strategy will ensure that when a user switches between blog post routes, the components associated with those routes are reused, providing a smoother and faster user experience.

1. **Create a Custom Route Reuse Strategy:**

Start by creating a new TypeScript file for your custom `RouteReuseStrategy`. Let's call it `blog-route-reuse.strategy.ts`.

```typescript
import { RouteReuseStrategy, ActivatedRouteSnapshot, DetachedRouteHandle } from '@angular/router';

export class BlogRouteReuseStrategy implements RouteReuseStrategy {
  private storedHandles: { [key: string]: DetachedRouteHandle } = {};

  shouldDetach(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot): boolean {
    return route.data && route.data.reuse;
  }

  store(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, handle: DetachedRouteHandle): void {
    if (route.data && route.data.reuse) {
      this.storedHandles[this.getRouteKey(route)] = handle;
    }
  }

  shouldAttach(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot): boolean {
    return !!this.storedHandles[this.getRouteKey(route)];
  }

  retrieve(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot): DetachedRouteHandle | null {
    return this.storedHandles[this.getRouteKey(route)];
  }

  shouldReuseRoute(future: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, current: ActivatedRouteSnapshot): boolean {
    return future.routeConfig === current.routeConfig && JSON.stringify(future.params) === JSON.stringify(current.params);
  }

  private getRouteKey(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot): string {
    const url = route.url.map(segment => segment.toString()).join('/');
    return url;
  }
}
```

2. **Provide the Custom Route Reuse Strategy:**

In your `app.module.ts` file, provide your custom route reuse strategy in the providers array:

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, RouteReuseStrategy } from '@angular/router';
import { BlogRouteReuseStrategy } from './path-to-your-blog-route-reuse-strategy';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    RouterModule.forRoot(routes)
  ],
  providers: [
    { provide: RouteReuseStrategy, useClass: BlogRouteReuseStrategy }
  ],
})
export class AppModule { }
```

3. **Usage in Route Configuration:**

Now, when you define your routes for the blog posts, you can indicate which routes should be subject to reuse. In your route configuration, set the `data` property with a `reuse` field to `true` for the blog post routes that you want to reuse:

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'blog', component: BlogListComponent },
  { path: 'blog/:id', component: BlogPostComponent, data: { reuse: true } },
  // Other routes...
];
```

In this example, the `BlogPostComponent` is set to be reused based on the `data` property.

4. **Testing the Behavior:**

With this setup, when a user navigates between different blog posts, the `BlogPostComponent` associated with each route will be reused instead of being destroyed and recreated. This can significantly improve the performance and user experience when switching between blog posts.

## **Scenario: E-Commerce Product Details Page**

Imagine you're developing an e-commerce website where users can browse and purchase products. One crucial aspect of the application is the product details page, where users can view in-depth information about a specific product.

In this scenario, you can use the `RouteReuseStrategy` feature to enhance the user experience and optimize the performance of the application.

**Problem:** Without a proper route reuse strategy, whenever a user navigates to a different product details page and then goes back to the previous product details page, the component associated with the product details route will be destroyed and recreated each time. This can lead to slow performance and a suboptimal user experience, especially if the product details page contains complex UI elements, images, and data fetching.

**Solution:** By implementing a custom `RouteReuseStrategy`, you can control the behavior of component reuse for the product details page. Here's how you can use the `RouteReuseStrategy` in this scenario:

1. **Custom Route Reuse Strategy:** Create a custom `RouteReuseStrategy` that checks whether the route being navigated to is a product details route. If it is, you can specify that this route should be reused based on certain conditions, such as if the product IDs match.

2. **Reuse Logic:** Inside the custom strategy's `shouldReuseRoute` method, compare the product IDs of the current and future routes. If the product IDs are the same, return `true` to indicate that the route should be reused. This means that when a user navigates back and forth between different product details pages, the component won't be destroyed and recreated every time, improving the perceived performance.

3. **Smooth Navigation:** When users navigate between different product details pages, the component associated with the route will be reused, minimizing unnecessary rendering and data fetching. This results in a smoother and more responsive user experience.

4. **Resource Optimization:** Reusing the product details component reduces the load on the server and improves client-side performance, as the component retains its state and doesn't need to be fetched or re-rendered.

By implementing the `RouteReuseStrategy` in this scenario, you effectively optimize the navigation and performance of the e-commerce application, providing users with a seamless and efficient way to explore different product details without sacrificing performance.

Remember to customize the code according to your application's needs and folder structure. This example demonstrates how to create a custom `RouteReuseStrategy` specifically for handling blog post routes, but you can adapt the concept for other scenarios as well.
